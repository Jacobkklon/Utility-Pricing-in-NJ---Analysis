# Utility-Pricing-in-NJ---Analysis
This was a project I did focused on analysis of Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) in the NJ. I leveraged data from each of the major NJ electricity providers (such as PSEG and ACE) to identify how utility pricing data changed over time and plot it. This project showcases my ability with matplotlib as well as my ability to manipulate and work with data in Pandas.
